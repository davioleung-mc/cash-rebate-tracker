# Blockchain Core Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the core components of a blockchain system following Spec Kit methodology.

## Components

### 1. Block Structure
- **Header**: Contains metadata about the block
- **Transactions**: Array of valid transactions
- **Hash**: Unique identifier computed from block contents
- **Previous Hash**: Link to the previous block in the chain
- **Timestamp**: When the block was created
- **Nonce**: Proof-of-work value

### 2. Transaction Structure
- **From**: Sender's address
- **To**: Recipient's address
- **Amount**: Transfer amount
- **Fee**: Transaction fee
- **Signature**: Digital signature for authentication
- **Timestamp**: When transaction was created

### 3. Blockchain State
- **Current Chain**: Array of validated blocks
- **Pending Transactions**: Transactions waiting for inclusion
- **Difficulty**: Mining difficulty adjustment
- **Genesis Block**: The first block in the chain

## Implementation Requirements

### Block Validation
1. Verify block hash is correct
2. Check proof-of-work meets difficulty requirement
3. Validate all transactions in the block
4. Ensure previous hash matches last block

### Transaction Validation
1. Verify digital signature
2. Check sender has sufficient balance
3. Validate transaction format
4. Prevent double-spending

### Chain Consensus
1. Longest valid chain wins
2. Handle chain forks appropriately
3. Reject invalid blocks
4. Maintain network synchronization

## API Interface
- `addTransaction(transaction)`: Add new transaction to pending pool
- `mineBlock()`: Mine a new block with pending transactions
- `validateChain()`: Verify entire blockchain integrity
- `getBalance(address)`: Calculate address balance
- `getBlock(hash)`: Retrieve specific block
- `getChain()`: Get entire blockchain
